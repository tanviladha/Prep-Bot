      "\n",
      "Once you get into the coding questions, communication is key. A candidate who needs some help along the way but communicates clearly can be even better than a candidate who breezes through the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understand what kind of problem it is. There are two types of problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "Coding. The interviewer wants to see you write clean, efficient code for a problem. Chitchat. The interviewer just wants you to talk about something. These questions are often either (1) high-level system design (\"How would you build a Twitter clone?\") or (2) trivia (\"What is hoisting in Javascript?\"). Sometimes the trivia is a lead-in for a \"real\" question e.g., \"How quickly can we sort a list of integers? Good, now suppose instead of integers we had . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If you start writing code and the interviewer just wanted a quick chitchat answer before moving on to the \"real\" question, they'll get frustrated. Just ask, \"Should we write code for this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Make it feel like you're on a team. The interviewer wants to know what it feels like to work through a problem with you, so make the interview feel collaborative. Use \"we\" instead of \"I,\" as in, \"If we did a breadth-first search we'd get an answer in time.\" If you get to choose between coding on paper and coding on a whiteboard, always choose the whiteboard. That way you'll be situated next to the interviewer, facing the problem (rather than across from her at a table).\n",
      "\n",
      "Think out loud. Seriously. Say, \"Let's try doing it this way—not sure yet if it'll work.\" If you're stuck, just say what you're thinking. Say what might work. Say what you thought could work and why it doesn't work. This also goes for trivial chitchat questions. When asked to explain Javascript closures, \"It's something to do with scope and putting stuff in a function\" will probably get you 90% credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Say you don't know. If you're touching on a fact (e.g., language-specific trivia, a hairy bit of runtime analysis), don't try to appear to know something you don't. Instead, say \"I'm not sure, but I'd guess $thing, because...\". The because can involve ruling out other options by showing they have nonsensical implications, or pulling examples from other languages or other problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slow the eff down. Don't confidently blurt out an answer right away. If it's right you'll still have to explain it, and if it's wrong you'll seem reckless. You don't win anything for speed and you're more likely to annoy your interviewer by cutting her off or appearing to jump to conclusions. Back in 2017, I went through some coding interviews and got offers from several large tech companies. So at that point, I decided to share what I'd learned in this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I've just updated it for 2022 so it'll be super useful and relevant if you're job hunting now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite scoring decent grades in both my CS101 Algorithm class and my Data Structures class in university, I shudder at the thought of going through a coding interview that focuses on algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence I spent the last three months figuring out how to improve my coding interview skills and eventually received offers from big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Lyft, Dropbox and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this post, I’ll be sharing the insights and tips I gained along the way. Experienced candidates can also expect System Design questions, but that is out of the scope of this post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the algorithmic concepts tested in coding interviews are not what I usually use at work, where I am a Front End Engineer (web). Naturally, I have forgotten quite a bit about these algorithms and data structures, which I learned mostly during my freshmen and sophomore years of college.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s stressful to have to produce (working) code in an interview, while someone scrutinizes every keystroke that you make. What’s worse is that as an interviewee, you’re encouraged to communicate your thought process out loud to the interviewer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to think that being able to think, code, and communicate simultaneously was an impossible feat, until I realized that most people are just not good at coding interviews when they first start out. Interviewing is a skill that you can get better at by studying, preparing, and practicing for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My recent job search has led me on a journey to improve my coding interview skills. Front End Engineers like to rant about how the current hiring process is broken because technical interviews can include skills not related to front-end development. For example, writing a maze solving algorithm and merging two sorted lists of numbers. As a Front End Engineer myself, I can empathize with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Front end is a specialized domain where engineers have to care about many issues related to browser compatibilities, the Document Object Model, JavaScript performance, CSS layouts, and so on. It is uncommon for front-end engineers to implement some of the complex algorithms tested in interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "At companies like Facebook and Google, the people are software engineers first, domain experts second.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, rules are set by the companies, not the candidates. There is a high emphasis on general computer science concepts like algorithms, design patterns, data structures; core skills that a good software engineer should possess. If you want the job, you have to play by the rules set by the game masters — improve your coding interview skills!\n",

      "Picking a programming language\n",
      "\n",
      "Before anything else, you need to pick a programming language for your algorithmic coding interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most companies will allow you to code in the language of your choice. The only exception I know is Google. They allow their candidates to pick from only Java, C++, Python, Go or JavaScript.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most part, I recommend using a language that you are extremely familiar with, rather than one that is new to you but that the company uses widely.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some languages that are more suitable than others for coding interviews. Then there are some that you absolutely want to avoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "From my experience as an interviewer, most candidates pick Python or Java. Other languages commonly selected include JavaScript, Ruby, and C++. I would absolutely avoid lower-level languages like C or Go, simply because they lack standard library functions and data structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, Python is my de facto choice for coding algorithms during interviews. It is succinct and has a huge library of functions and data structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the top reasons I recommend Python is that it uses consistent APIs that operate on different data structures, such as len() , for ... in ... and slicing notation on sequences (strings, lists, and tuples). Getting the last element in a sequence is arr[-1] , and reversing it is simply arr[::-1] . You can achieve a lot with minimal syntax in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Java is a decent choice too. But because you will have to constantly declare types in your code, it means entering extra keystrokes. This will slow down the speed at which you code and type. This issue will be more apparent when you have to write on a whiteboard during on-site interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons for choosing or not choosing C++ are similar to Java. Ultimately, Python, Java, and C++ are decent choices. If you have been using Java for a while, and do not have time to become familiar with another language, I recommend sticking to Java instead of picking up Python from scratch. This helps you to avoid having to use one language for work and another one for interviews. Most of the time, the bottleneck is in the thinking and not the writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One exception to the convention of allowing the candidate to “pick any programming language they want” is when the interview is for a domain-specific position, such as front-end, iOS, or Android engineer roles. You need to be familiar with coding algorithms in JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, and Java, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to use a data structure that the language does not support, such as a queue or heap in JavaScript, ask the interviewer if you can assume that you have a data structure that implements certain methods with specified time complexities. If the implementation of that data structure is not crucial to solving the problem, the interviewer will usually allow it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, being aware of existing data structures and selecting the appropriate ones to tackle the problem at hand is more important than knowing the intricate implementation details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review your CS101\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have been out of college for some time, it is highly advisable to review the CS fundamentals. I prefer to review it as I practice. I scan through my notes from college and revise the various algorithms as I work on the algorithm problems from LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out Lago, a GitHub repository containing Data Structures and Algorithms examples in JavaScript.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mastery through practice\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, gain familiarity and mastery of the algorithms and data structures in your chosen programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practice and solve algorithm questions in your chosen language. While Cracking the Coding Interview is a good resource, I prefer solving problems by typing code, letting it run, and getting instant feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are various Online Judges, such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeForces for you to practice questions online and to get used to the language. From my experience, LeetCode questions are most similar to the questions asked in interviews. HackerRank and CodeForces questions are more similar to questions in competitive programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you practice enough LeetCode questions, there is a good chance that you will either see or complete one of your actual interview questions (or some variant of it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Learn and understand the time and space complexities of the common operations in your chosen language. For Python, this page will come in handy. Also, learn about the underlying sorting algorithm being used in the language’s sort() function and its time and space complexities (in Python it’s Timsort, which is a hybrid).\n",
      "\n",
      "After completing a question on LeetCode, I usually add the time and space complexities of the written code as comments above the function body. I use the comments to remind myself to communicate the analysis of the algorithm after I have completed the implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read up on the recommended coding style for your language and stick to it. If you choose Python, refer to the PEP 8 Style Guide. If you choose Java, refer to Google’s Java Style Guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learn about and be familiar with the common pitfalls and caveats of the language. If you point them out during the interview and avoid falling into them, you will earn bonus points and impress the interviewer, regardless of whether the interviewer is familiar with the language or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gain a broad exposure to questions from various topics. In the second half of the article, I mention algorithm topics and the useful questions for each topic to practice. Do around 100 to 200 LeetCode questions, and you should be good.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you prefer courses where the learning is more structured, here are a few recommendations. In no way is taking online courses a must in order to pass interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "AlgoMonster aims to help you ace the technical interview in the shortest time possible .

      "\n",
      "And of course, practice, practice, and more practice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Phases of a coding interview\n",
      "\n",
      "Congratulations, you are ready to put your skills to practice! In a coding interview, you will be given a technical question by the interviewer. You will write the code in a real-time, collaborative editor (phone screen) or on a whiteboard (on-site), and have 30 to 45 minutes to solve the problem. This is where the real fun begins!\n",
      "\n",
      "Your interviewer will be looking to see that you meet the requirements of the role. It is up to you to show them that you have the skills. Initially, it may feel weird to talk while you code, as most programmers do not make a habit of explaining out loud their thoughts while they are typing code.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is hard for the interviewer to know what you are thinking by just looking at your code. If you communicate your approach to the interviewer even before you start to code, you can validate your approach with them. This way, the two of you can agree on an acceptable approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparing for a remote interview\n",
      "\n",
      "For phone screens and remote interviews, have a paper and pen or pencil to jot down any notes or diagrams. If you are given a question about trees and graphs, it usually helps if you draw examples of the data structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use earphones. Make sure you are in a quiet environment. You do not want to be holding a phone in one hand and typing with the other. Try to avoid using speakers. If the feedback is bad, communication is made harder. Having to repeat yourself will just result in the loss of valuable time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to do when you get the question\n",
      "\n",
      "Many candidates start coding as soon as they hear the question. That is usually a big mistake. First, take a moment and repeat the question back to the interviewer to make sure that you understand the question. If you misunderstand the question, then the interviewer can clarify.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always seek clarification about the question upon hearing it, even if you think it is clear. You might discover that you have missed something. It also lets the interviewer know that you are attentive to details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider asking the following questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "How big is the size of the input?\n",
      "\n",
      "How big is the range of values?\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of values are there? Are there negative numbers? Floating points? Will there be empty inputs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there duplicates within the input?\n",
      "\n",
      "What are some extreme cases of the input?\n",
      "\n",
      "How is the input stored? If you are given a dictionary of words, is it a list of strings or a trie?\n",
      "\n",
      "After you have sufficiently clarified the scope and intention of the problem, explain your high-level approach to the interviewer, even if it is a naive solution. If you are stuck, consider various approaches and explain out loud why it may or may not work. Sometimes your interviewer might drop hints and lead you toward the right path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start with a brute-force approach. Communicate it to the interviewer. Explain the time and space complexities and clarify why it is bad. It is unlikely that the brute-force approach will be the one that you will be coding. At this point, the interviewer will usually pop the dreaded, “Can we do better?” question. This means they are looking for a more optimal approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is usually the hardest part of the interview. In general, look for repeated work and try to optimize them by potentially caching the calculated result somewhere. Reference it later, rather than computing it all over again. I provide some tips on tackling topic-specific questions in detail below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only start coding after you and your interviewer have agreed on an approach and you have been given the green light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting to code\n",
      "\n",
      "Use a good style to write your code. Reading code written by others is usually not an enjoyable task. Reading horribly formatted code written by others is even worse. Your goal is to make your interviewer understand your code so that they can quickly evaluate if your code does what it is suppose to and if it solves a given problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use clear variable names and avoid names that are single letters, unless they are for iteration. However, if you are coding on a whiteboard, avoid using verbose variable names. This reduces the amount of writing you will have to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always explain to the interviewer what you are writing or typing. This is not about reading, verbatim, to the interviewer the code you are producing. Talk about the section of the code you are currently implementing at a higher level. Explain why it is written as such, and what it is trying to achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you copy and paste in code, consider whether it is necessary. Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not. If you find yourself copying and pasting a large chunk of code spanning multiple lines, it is probably an indicator that you can restructure the code by extracting those lines into a function. If it is just a single line you copied, usually it is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, remember to change the respective variables in your copied line of code where relevant. Copying and pasting errors are a common source of bugs, even in day-to-day coding!\n",
      "\n",
      "After coding\n",
      "\n",
      "After you have finished coding, do not immediately announce to the interviewer that you are done. In most cases, your code is usually not perfect. It may contain bugs or syntax errors. What you need to do is review your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, look through your code from start to finish. Look at it as if it were written by someone else, and you are seeing it for the first time and trying to spot bugs in it. That’s exactly what your interviewer will be doing. Review and fix any issues you may find.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, come up with small test cases and step through the code (not your algorithm) with those sample input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewers like it when you read their minds. What they usually do after you have finished coding is get you to write tests. It is a huge plus if you write tests for your code even before they prompt you to do so. You should be emulating a debugger when stepping through your code. Jot down or tell them the values of certain variables as you walk the interviewer through the lines of code.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there are large duplicated chunks of code in your solution, restructure the code to show the interviewer that you value quality coding. Also, look out for places where you can do short-circuit evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, give the time and space complexities of your code, and explain why it is such. You can annotate chunks of your code with their various time and space complexities to demonstrate your understanding of the code. You can even provide the APIs of your chosen programming language. Explain any trade-offs in your current approach versus alternative approaches, possibly in terms of time and space.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here. It is also common that the interviewer asks you extension questions, such as how you would handle the problem if the whole input is too large to fit into memory, or if the input arrives as a stream. This is a common follow-up question at Google, where they care a lot about scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is usually a divide-and-conquer approach — perform distributed processing of the data and only read certain chunks of the input from disk into memory, write the output back to disk and combine them later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practice with mock interviews\n",
      "\n",
      "The steps mentioned above can be rehearsed over and over again until you have fully internalized them and they become second nature to you. A good way to practice is by partnering with a friend and taking turns to interview each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great resource for preparing for coding interviews is interviewing.io. This platform provides free and anonymous practice interviews with Google and Facebook engineers, which can lead to real jobs and internships.\n",
      "\n",
      "By virtue of being anonymous during the interview, the inclusive interview process is unbiased and low risk. At the end of the interview, both the interviewer and interviewee can provide feedback to each other for the purpose of helping one another improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing well in mock interviews will unlock the jobs page for candidates, and allow them to book interviews (also anonymously) with top companies like Uber, Lyft, Quora, Asana, and more. For those who are new to coding interviews, a demo interview can be viewed on this site. Note that this site requires users to sign in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have used interviewing.io, both as an interviewer and an interviewee. The experience was great. Aline Lerner, the CEO and co-founder of interviewing.io, and her team are passionate about revolutionizing the process for coding interviews and helping candidates improve their interview skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has also published a number of coding interview-related articles on the interviewing.io blog. I recommend signing up as early as possible with interviewing.io, even though it's in beta, to increase the likelihood of receiving an invite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another platform that allows you to practice coding interviews is Pramp. Where interviewing.io matches potential job seekers with seasoned coding interviewers, Pramp takes a different approach. Pramp pairs you up with another peer who is also a job seeker. The two of you take turns assuming the roles of interviewer and interviewee. Pramp also prepares questions, and provides solutions and prompts to guide the interviewee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go forth and conquer\n",
      "\n",

      "General tips\n",
      "\n",
      "Always validate input first. Check for inputs that are invalid, empty, negative, or different. Never assume you are given the valid parameters. Alternatively, clarify with the interviewer whether you can assume valid input (usually yes), which can save you time from writing code that does input validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there any time and space complexities requirements or constraints?\n",
      "\n",
      "Check for off-by-one errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In languages where there are no automatic type coercion, check that concatenation of values are of the same type: int , str , and list .\n",
      "\n",
      "After you finish your code, use a few example inputs to test your solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the algorithm supposed to run multiple times, perhaps on a web server? If yes, the input can likely be pre-processed to improve the efficiency in each API call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use a mix of functional and imperative programming paradigms:\n",
      "\n",
      "Write pure functions as often as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use pure functions because they are easier to reason with and can help reduce bugs in your implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid mutating the parameters passed into your function, especially if they are passed by reference, unless you are sure of what you are doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieve a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Use the right amount of functional and imperative code where appropriate. Functional programming is usually expensive in terms of space complexity because of non-mutation and the repeated allocation of new objects. On the other hand, imperative code is faster because you operate on existing objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid relying on mutating global variables. Global variables introduce state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure that you do not accidentally mutate global variables, especially if you have to rely on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, to improve the speed of a program, we can choose to either use an appropriate data structure or algorithm, or to use more memory. It’s a classic space and time trade off.\n",

      "Data structures are your weapons. Choosing the right weapon for the right battle is the key to victory. Know the strengths of each data structure and the time complexity for its various operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data structures can be augmented to achieve efficient time complexity across different operations. For example, a HashMap can be used together with a doubly-linked list to achieve O(1) time complexity for both the get and put operation in an LRU cache.\n",
      "\n",
      "HashMaps are probably the most commonly used data structure for algorithm questions. If you are stuck on a question, your last resort can be to enumerate through the possible data structures (thankfully there aren’t that many) and consider whether each of them can be applied to the problem. This has worked for me at times.\n",

      "If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer, and explain to them what you would do outside of an interview setting (no time constraints).

      "Largest programming competition in Nord-Western Europe\n",
      "\n",
      "My name is Andrei and I’ve been a competitive programmer for the last five years. I’ve participated in the World Finals of Google HashCode, the largest algorithmic competition organised by Google, and before that, I won three Gold Medals in the Computing Olympiad in Romania. Having this experience, I’ve published the online course “Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures in C++” that has been helping over 8000 students from 135 countries with their first steps in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I’m studying Computer Science at University College London and meanwhile, I’m creating a course to help students and young professionals to prepare for the coding interview in the big tech companies. Hence, in this article, I want to share my experience with the coding interview and tell you the straightest way to pass it. You can reach me here.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the coding interview?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me ask you a question: have you ever dreamed of working in a big tech company, like Microsoft? If so, be sure that most of us did, too. And because there is such a high demand for a few dozen jobs, they need a way to see which candidates are better prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you get invited to the coding interview, you need to apply for the position and have a CV that shines among the others. In this article, I’ll talk about the actual coding interview and how you can prepare for it, and not about the application process for the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "For most tech companies, the coding interview consists of Algorithms & Data structures problems. Think of these as problem-solving questions, in which the interviewer is looking to evaluate your ability to solve a problem that you haven’t seen before. One interview takes roughly 45 minutes and you are given one or two coding problems. The interviewer is expecting you to find the most optimal solution, code it and explain what you have just coded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, you will have the chance to ask him some questions about the company or anything that interests you. We will comprehensively discuss all these steps in the last part of this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to prepare for the coding interview?\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to be clear with you from the beginning: there is no such shortcut or trick to pass the interview. The single way to find optimal solutions to algorithmic problems is by practicing, solving as many problems as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In two words, it’s hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may not like it and start looking somewhere else for a trick to understand how to solve interview questions, but it doesn’t exist. Think for a second: if there would be such a trick, why wouldn’t everyone use it and pass the interview?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you need to understand that the single variable of passing the interview is how much you practice before. Your experience, intelligence and everything else is already fixed. Hence, the time spent on practice will make the difference between the candidates who pass and fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coding interview is a fight with yourself, and the single way to win it is to practice a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step is to feel comfortable with a mainstream coding language, such as C/C++, Java or Python. Some companies also accept other languages, and the clear majority stick with these three. Pick the one you like most and stick with it. Don’t decide halfway through preparation that you want to change the language! For the rest of the article, I will assume that you’ve chosen a language and know well its syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, typically the coding interview is all about Algorithms and Data structures. They include some fundamental topics that you need to understand thoroughly, and don’t even consider going to the interview without feeling comfortable with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below there is a list of the Algorithms and Data structures that you need to know. I’ve written them in order of their importance and it is the best learning path.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Big O complexity: It’s a must and forms the underlying foundation of your algorithmic thinking. Understand what it means and arrive at the point when you can say the complexity of a basic algorithm just from looking at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Arrays: You should be familiar with the concept of arrays at this point. This topic refers to problems where the array is used just for storage and the solution includes basic techniques, such as iterating with two pointers. A classic problem is to check if a given array is a permutation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Strings: Know how to manipulate a string in your language, and be familiar with problems that ask you to concatenate or rotate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Linked Lists: It’s common to encounter a linked list problem in the interview. Here you need to pay special attention to the corner cases. Think what happens if the linked list is empty? Or it has just one element? Or you want to iterate until the last element? When you solve a problem with linked lists, think twice about the corner cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Hash Tables: Fundamental data structure that is present in most interviews. If you go deeper in one topic, choose hash tables. Be fluent in the hash tables library of your language and practice at least five problems. In the end, take this challenge: How would you find the longest subarray with distinct entries?\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Stacks: Be familiar with the idea that you can manipulate just one end of the stack. Solve this challenge: Implement a Stack with a MAX API, meaning that at every moment you can ask what is the maximum element in the stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Queues: Don’t confuse them with stacks, because they have two ends. Implement the classic problem of simulating a queue using two stacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Greedy: This technique is quite simple and you probably use it every day. It basically refers to taking the best decision possible at a specific moment, without considering future consequences. Practice a few problems, and don’t think that any problem can be solved using Greedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Primitive types: It is mostly concerned with bit manipulation and basic operations on numbers. However, some problems can become quite tricky. How can you count the number of 1’s in a binary representation?\n",
      "\n",
      "10) Binary trees: Focus on traversals, common ancestors and recursively iterate through the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Heaps: They are widely used in real world application, so get to know heaps! Practice until you can be confident when to use a min-heap or a max-heap. How would you print the biggest five elements from a number sequence? Do you use a min-heap or a max-heap?\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Searching: Searching is a core subject that everyone should know. So, practice at least three problems using binary search.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Sorting: Be sure that you can implement mergesort and quicksort. Know very well their best, average and worst case complexities. If you have time, also learn Heapsort.\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Binary Search Trees: They are widely asked in the coding interview, and you need to be able to implement all their basic operations, including the deletion of an element!\n",
      "\n",
      "15) Backtracking: It basically means generating all possible solutions and take the ones which respect to your requirements. Implement a generator of the power set of the set and the n-Queen problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "16) Graphs: They are probably the most used data structure in computer science. Did you know that every social network is just a huge graph? Practice on making a copy of the graph in memory and detecting cycles in graphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "17) Dynamic programming: Dynamic programming is seen by most as the scariest topic. But it’s the most beautiful if you understand the thinking behind it. So, practice the top five most common questions and stick with them until you understand where the recurrences come from.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course, I’m creating now, I’m explaining each topic in this order. I’m still working on the course, but you can get early access to some of the lessons and also help me with your feedback, by joining the course Facebook group.\n",
      "\n",
      "If many topics are unfamiliar to you, it means that you need to start practicing right after this article. No more searching online other guides, just go and practice. Remember that the interview is a fight with yourself, the more you practice, the higher your chance of winning. It’s up to you to increase your problems comfort zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to give your best during the coding interview?\n",
      "\n",
      "The interview has five parts which we’ll discuss in depth. Watch the explanatory videos for real examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "This part commences the interview and takes about three to five minutes. The interviewer wants to find out more about you and gives you the chance to present yourself. Typically, he is interested in what projects you have worked on before and which was the most impressive one. Now, this is your chance to shine, so don’t waste it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t try to be flattering. It’s easy to spot a fake personality that tries to trick you. Me and everyone else hate those people, so be sure you show your true personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "You need to know beforehand what you are going to say about your favourite project, so prepare it before the interview. Now, most people say just two short sentences, which is bad. Which answer do you like more?\n",
      "\n",
      "1) “I worked on a web application to better manage patients in hospitals. I wrote the backend in Node.js.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The way you present yourself really matters\n",
      "\n",
      "2) “A project that I really enjoyed was about creating a web application for the National Health Services of the UK to help them to better manage the patients in the hospital. It was part of the University curriculum, it took two months and I have been the leader of a team of three. We took the project from a basic idea and turned it into a real application. I was responsible for coding the backend in Node.js and database in MongoDB. It was the first application I’ve ever created for a client and I wasn’t familiar with the web technologies. The developing process was iterative, and we made some mistakes on the way. In the end, we over-delivered with many features, and my favourite one is that the users can update the rooms of the hospital, instead of being hard coded. I learned many things from this project, especially how to work in a team. There were some moments in which technical or team problems arose, but in the end, everything went well and we got the highest mark of the year!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn this presentation into your advantage! The interviewer is truly interested in finding more about you, so start with a concise introduction of the project, explaining what it’s about. Then say what was your contribution (if you helped the team with a smart idea, say it!), and what you learnt from the developing process. You can also mention what difference you made for the users.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should talk one-two minutes about your project.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Understand the problem\n",
      "\n",
      "The interviewer will briefly tell you the problem statement that you need to solve. I said ‘briefly’ because he won’t give you many details about the constraints, corner cases or how you receive the data. It’s part of your job to ask for everything that you need to solve the problem. Repeat the statement loud to be sure that you got it correctly. The preparation for acing a tech interview starts with a complete and worthwhile roadmap or preparation plan.

how the current hiring process is broken because technical interviews can include skills not related to front-end development.', 'For example, writing a maze solving algorithm and merging two sorted lists of numbers.', 'As a Front End Engineer myself, I can empathize with them.', 'Front end is a specialized domain where engineers have to care about many issues related to browser compatibilities, the Document Object Model, JavaScript performance, CSS layouts, and so on.', 'It is uncommon for front-end engineers to implement some of the complex algorithms tested in interviews.', 'At companies

will allow you to code in the language of your choice.', 'The only exception I know is Google.', 'They allow their candidates to pick from only Java, C++, Python, Go or JavaScript.', 'For the most part, I recommend using a language that you are extremely familiar with, rather than one that is new to you but that the company uses widely.', 'There are some languages that are more suitable than others for coding interviews.', 'Then there are some that you absolutely want to avoid.', 'From my experience as an interviewer, most candidates pick Python or Java.', 'Other languages commonly selected include JavaScript, Ruby, and C++.', 'I would absolutely avoid lower-level languages like C or Go, simply because they lack standard library functions and data structures.', 'Personally, Python is my de facto choice for coding algorithms during interviews.', 'It is succinct and has a huge library of functions and data structures.', 'One of the top reasons I recommend Python is that it uses consistent APIs that operate on different data structures, such as len() , for ... in ... and slicing notation on sequences (strings, lists, and tuples).', 'Getting the last element in a sequence is arr[-1] , and reversing it is simply arr[::-1] .', 'You can achieve a lot with minimal syntax in Python.', 'Java is a decent choice too.', 'But because you will have to constantly declare types in your code, it means entering extra keystrokes.', 'This will slow down the speed at which you code and type.', 'This issue will be more apparent when you have to write on a whiteboard during on-site interviews.', 'The reasons for choosing or not choosing C++ are similar to Java.', 'Ultimately, Python, Java, and C++ are decent choices.', 'If you have been using Java for a while, and do not have time to become familiar with another language, I recommend sticking to Java instead of picking up Python from scratch.', 'This helps you to avoid having to use one language for work and another one for interviews.', 'Most of the time, the bottleneck is in the thinking and not the writing.', 'One exception to the convention of allowing the candidate to “pick any programming language they want” is when the interview is for a domain-specific position, such as front-end, iOS, or Android engineer roles.', 'You need to be familiar with coding algorithms in JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, and Java, respectively.', 'If you need to use a data structure that the language does not support, such as a queue or heap in JavaScript, ask the interviewer if you can assume that you have a data structure that implements certain methods with specified time complexities.', 'If the implementation of that data structure is not crucial to solving the problem, the interviewer will usually allow it.', 'In reality, being aware of existing data structures and selecting the appropriate ones to tackle the problem at hand is more important than knowing the intricate implementation details.', 'Review your

the question.', 'If you misunderstand the question, then the interviewer can clarify.', 'Always seek clarification about the question upon hearing it, even if you think it is clear.', 'You might discover that you have missed something.', 'It also lets the interviewer know that you are attentive to details.', 'Consider asking the following questions.', 'How big is the size of the input?', 'How big is the range of values?', 'What kind of values are there?', 'Are there negative numbers?', 'Floating points?', 'Will there be empty inputs?', 'Are there duplicates within the input?', 'What are some extreme cases of the input?', 'How is the input stored?', 'If you are given a dictionary of words, is it a list of strings or a trie?', 'After you have sufficiently clarified the scope and intention of the problem, explain your high-level approach to the interviewer, even if it is a naive solution.', 'If you are stuck, consider various approaches and explain out loud why it may or may not work.', 'Sometimes your interviewer might drop hints and lead you toward the right path.', 'Start with a brute-force approach.', 'Communicate it to the interviewer.', 'Explain the time and space complexities and clarify why it is bad.', 'It is unlikely that the brute-force approach will be the one that you will be coding.', 'At this point, the interviewer will usually pop the dreaded, “Can we do better?” question.', 'This means they are looking for a more optimal approach.', 'This is usually the hardest part of the interview.', 'In general, look for repeated work and try to optimize them by potentially caching the calculated result somewhere.', 'Reference it later, rather than computing it all over again.', 'I provide some tips on tackling topic-specific questions in detail below.',

is written as such, and what it is trying to achieve.', 'When you copy and paste in code, consider whether it is necessary.', 'Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not.', 'If you find yourself copying and pasting a large chunk of code spanning multiple lines, it is probably an indicator that you can restructure the code by extracting those lines into a function.', 'If it is just a single line you

values of certain variables as you walk the interviewer through the lines of code.', 'If there are large duplicated chunks of code in your solution, restructure the code to show the interviewer that you value quality coding.', 'Also, look out for places where you can do short-circuit evaluation.', 'Lastly, give the time and space complexities of your code, and explain why it is such.', 'You can annotate chunks of your code with their various time and space complexities to demonstrate your understanding of the code.', 'You can even provide the APIs of your chosen programming language.', 'Explain any trade-offs in your current approach versus alternative approaches, possibly in terms of time and space.', 'If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here.', 'It is also common that the interviewer asks you extension questions, such as how you would handle the problem if the whole input is too large to fit into memory, or if the input arrives as a stream.', 'This is a common follow-up question at Google, where they care a lot about scale.', 'The answer is usually a divide-and-conquer approach — perform distributed processing of the data and

contains everything you need to know about the coding interview.', 'It explains thoroughly what to learn, how to learn and more importantly how to present the solution during the interview.', 'If you want to pass the coding interview, you found the right article.', 'After reading this you might be tempted to search for other articles on the same topic, because “Maybe I’ll find more tips and tricks that will help me”.', 'Stop looking for tips and tricks, this is what keeps you away from your dream job.', 'There is no tips nor tricks to get that job.', 'It’s just hard work, period.', 'So if you really want to crush that interview, go and practice after reading this article.', 'The article has three parts & three videos and it will take around 30 minutes to read.', 'What is the coding interview?', 'How to prepare for the coding interview?', 'How to give your best during the coding interview?', 'Firstly, let me present, so that you know that I’m confident in what I’m talking about.', 'Largest programming competition in Nord-Western Europe\\n\\nMy name is Andrei and I’ve been a competitive programmer for the last five years.', 'I’ve participated in the World Finals of Google HashCode, the largest algorithmic competition organised by Google, and before that, I won three Gold Medals in the Computing Olympiad in Romania.', 'Having this experience, I’ve published the online course “Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures in C++” that has been helping over 8000 students from 135 countries with their first steps in the field.', 'Now I’m studying Computer Science at University College London and meanwhile, I’m creating a course to help students and young professionals to prepare for the coding interview in the big tech companies.', 'Hence, in this article, I want to share my experience with the coding interview and tell you the straightest way to pass it.', 'You can reach me here.', 'What is the coding interview?', 'Let me ask you a question: have you ever dreamed of working in a big tech company, like Microsoft?', 'If so, be sure that most of us did, too.', 'And because there is such a high demand for a few dozen jobs, they need a way to see which candidates are better prepared.', 'Before you get invited to the coding interview, you need to apply for the position and have a CV that shines among the others.', 'In this article, I’ll talk about the actual coding interview and how you can prepare for it, and not about the application process for the job.', 'For most tech companies, the coding interview consists of Algorithms & Data structures problems.', 'Think of these as problem-solving questions, in which the interviewer is looking to evaluate your ability to solve a problem that you haven’t seen before.', 'One interview takes roughly 45 minutes and you are given one or two coding problems.', 'The interviewer is expecting you to find the most optimal solution, code it and explain what you have just coded.', 'Lastly, you will have the chance to ask him some questions about the company or anything that interests you.', 'We will comprehensively discuss all these steps in the last part of this article.', 'How to prepare for the coding interview?', 'I want to be clear with you from the beginning: there is no such shortcut or trick to pass the interview.', 'The single way to find optimal solutions to algorithmic problems is by practicing, solving as many problems as possible.', 'In two words, it’s hard work.', 'You may not like it and start looking somewhere else for a trick to understand how to solve interview questions, but it doesn’t exist.', 'Think for a second: if there would be such a trick, why wouldn’t everyone use it and pass the interview?', 'So, you need to understand that the single variable of passing the interview is how much you practice before.', 'Your experience, intelligence and everything else is already fixed.', 'Hence, the time spent on practice will make the difference between the candidates who pass and fail.', 'The coding interview is a fight with yourself, and the single way to win it is to practice a lot.', 'The first step is to feel comfortable with a mainstream coding language, such as C/C++, Java or Python.', 'Some companies also accept other languages, and the clear majority stick with these three.', 'Pick the one you like most and stick with it.', 'Don’t decide halfway through preparation that you want to change the language!', 'For the rest of the article, I will assume that you’ve chosen a language and know well its syntax.', 'Now, typically the coding interview is all about Algorithms and Data structures.', 'They include some fundamental topics that you need to understand thoroughly, and don’t even consider going to the interview without feeling comfortable with them.', 'Below there is a list of the Algorithms and Data structures that you need to know.', 'I’ve written them in order of their importance and it is the best learning path.', '1) Big O complexity: It’s a must and forms the underlying foundation of your algorithmic thinking.', 'Understand what it means and arrive at the point when you can say the complexity of a basic algorithm just from looking at it.', '2) Arrays: You should be familiar with the concept of arrays at this point.', 'This topic refers to problems where the array is used just for storage and the solution includes basic techniques, such as iterating with two pointers.', 'A classic problem is to check if a given array is a permutation.', '3) Strings: Know how to manipulate a string in your language, and be familiar with problems that ask you to concatenate or rotate them.', '4) Linked Lists: It’s common to encounter a linked list problem in the interview.', 'Here you need to pay special attention to the corner cases.', 'Think what happens if the linked list is empty?', 'Or it has just one element?', 'Or you want to iterate until the last element?', 'When you solve a problem with linked lists, think twice about the corner cases.', '5) Hash Tables: Fundamental data structure that is present in most interviews.', 'If you go deeper in one topic, choose hash tables.', 'Be fluent in the hash tables library of your language and practice at least five problems.', 'In the end, take this challenge: How would you find the longest subarray with distinct entries?', '6) Stacks: Be familiar with the idea that you can manipulate just one end of the stack.', 'Solve this challenge: Implement a Stack with a MAX API, meaning that at every moment you can ask what is the maximum element in the stack.', '7) Queues: Don’t confuse them with stacks, because they have two ends.', 'Implement the classic problem of simulating a queue using two stacks.', '8) Greedy: This technique is quite simple and you probably use it every day.', 'It basically refers to taking the best decision possible at a specific moment, without considering future consequences.', 'Practice a few problems, and don’t think that any problem can be solved using Greedy.', '9) Primitive types: It is mostly concerned with bit manipulation and basic operations on numbers.', 'However, some problems can become quite tricky.', 'How can you count the number of 1’s in a binary representation?', '10) Binary trees: Focus on traversals, common ancestors and recursively iterate through the trees.', '11) Heaps: They are widely used in real world application, so get to know heaps!', 'Practice until you can be confident when to use a min-heap or a max-heap.', 'How would you print the biggest five elements from a number sequence?', 'Do you use a min-heap or a max-heap?', '12) Searching: Searching is a core subject that everyone should know.', 'So, practice at least three problems using binary search.', '13) Sorting: Be sure that you can implement mergesort and quicksort.', 'Know very well their best, average and worst case complexities.', 'If you have time, also learn Heapsort.', '14) Binary Search Trees: They are widely asked in the coding interview, and you need to be able to implement all their basic operations, including the deletion of an element!', '15) Backtracking: It basically means generating all possible solutions and take the ones which respect to your requirements.', 'Implement a generator of the power set of the set and the n-Queen problem.', '16) Graphs: They are probably the most used data structure in computer science.', 'Did you know that every social network is just a huge graph?', 'Practice on making a copy of the graph in memory and detecting cycles in graphs.', '17) Dynamic programming: Dynamic programming is seen by most as the scariest topic.', 'But it’s the most beautiful if you understand the thinking behind it.', 'So, practice the top five most common questions and stick with them until you understand where the recurrences come from.', 'In the course, I’m creating now, I’m explaining each topic in this order.', 'I’m still working on the course, but you can get early access to some of the lessons and also help me with your feedback, by joining the course Facebook group.', 'If many topics are unfamiliar to you, it means that you need to start practicing right after this article.', 'No more searching online other guides, just go and practice.', 'Remember that the interview is a fight with yourself, the more you practice, the higher your chance of winning.', 'It’s up to you to increase your problems comfort zone.', 'How to give your best during the coding interview?', 'The interview has five parts which we’ll discuss in depth.', 'Watch the explanatory videos for real examples.', '1) Introduction\\n\\nThis part commences the interview and takes about three to five minutes.', 'The interviewer wants to find out more about you and gives you the chance to present yourself.', 'Typically, he is interested in what projects you have worked on before and which was the most impressive one.', 'Now, this is your chance to shine, so don’t waste it!', 'Don’t try to be flattering.', 'It’s easy to spot a fake personality that tries to trick you.', 'Me and everyone else hate those people, so be sure you show your true personality.', 'You need to know beforehand what you are going to say about your favourite project, so prepare it before the interview.', 'Now, most people say just two short sentences, which is bad.', 'Which answer do you like more?', '1) “I worked on a web application to better manage patients in hospitals.', 'I wrote the backend in Node.js.”\\n\\nThe way you present yourself really matters\\n\\n2) “A project that I really enjoyed was about creating a web application for the National Health Services of the UK to help them to better manage the patients in the

application.', 'I was responsible for coding the backend in Node.js and database in MongoDB.', 'It was the first application I’ve ever created for a client and I wasn’t familiar with the web technologies.', 'The developing process was iterative, and we made some mistakes on the way.', 'In the end, we over-delivered with many features, and my favourite one is that the users can update the rooms of the hospital, instead of being hard coded.', 'I learned many things from this project, especially how to work in a team.', 'There were some moments in which technical or team problems arose, but in the end, everything went well and we got the highest mark of the year!”\\n\\nTurn this presentation into your advantage!', 'The interviewer is truly interested in finding more about you, so start with a concise introduction of the project, explaining what it’s about.', 'Then say what was your contribution (if you helped the team with a smart idea, say it!', '), and what you learnt from the developing process.', 'You can also mention what difference you made for the users.', 'You should talk one-two minutes about your project.', '2) Understand the problem\\n\\nThe interviewer will briefly tell you the problem statement that you need to solve.', 'I said ‘briefly’ because he won’t give you many details about the constraints, corner cases or how you receive the data.', 'It’s part
